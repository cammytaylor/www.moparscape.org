[Version 1.0][1]

Backup your currently installed apps to a text file, which you can use later to reinstall them from the market easily.

You can also restore apps from the text file aTrackDog produces when you select “Export App List”.

File selection and progress bar for backup added in 1.0.

Code released under GNU/GPL on [GitHub][2].

Credits:

  * [OpenIntents][3] for the great, open source file selector I used.
  * [Unhandled][4] for the awesome icon.

Here are the screenshots that are on the market:
